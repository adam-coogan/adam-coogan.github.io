      <p>
        I find programming fun, and feel that part of doing good science is
        writing and sharing good code. Here are some repositories which I've
        written or to which I've contributed significantly, and some personal
        projects. Check out my <Link to="/research/">research</Link> page for
        code associated with specific physics papers.

          a web developer, this was my first foray into the field. Source code
