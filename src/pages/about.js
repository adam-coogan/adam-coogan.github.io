      <p>
        I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the GRAPPA institute at the
        University of Amsterdam. I did my Ph.D. at the University of California,
        Santa Cruz between 2012 and 2018. Before that I was an undergraduate at
        Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where I received my Sc.B.
        in mathematical physics. I'm originally from Rhode Island and grew up a
        15 minute drive outside of Providence.

        Outside of physics, I really like rock climbing (particularly
        bouldering), being outdoors, sailing, cooking lots of different types of
        food, learning languages and traveling.
